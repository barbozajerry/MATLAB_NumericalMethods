# MATLAB: Numerical Methods
Reviewing MATLAB by solving solutions from my book:  "Numerical Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of Algorithms" Author of the Book: Anne Greenbaum &amp; Timothy P. Chartier.

I used this book during my undergrad in Applied Mathematics at University of California, Davis.
