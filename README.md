# MATLAB: Numerical Methods
Reviewing MATLAB by solving solutions from my book:  "Numerical Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of Algorithms" Author of the Book: Anne Greenbaum &amp; Timothy P. Chartier.

I used this book during my undergrad in Applied Mathematics at University of California, Davis. I plan to go back to this book and solve problems from the chapters. 

# Chapter 1: Mathematical Modeling 
# Chapter 2: Basic Operations with MATLAB
# Chapter 3: Monte Carlo Methods 
# Chapter 4: Solution of a Single Nonlinear Equation in One Unknown
# Chapter 5: Floating-Point Arithmetic 
# Chapter 6: Conditioning of Problems; Stability of Algorithms
# Chapter 7: Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems and Least Squares Problems 
# Chapter 8: Polynomial and Piecewise Polynomial Interpolation 
# Chapter 9: Numerical Differentiation and Richardson Extrapolation 
# Chapter 10: Numerical Integration 
# Chapter 11: Numerical Solution of the Initial Value Problem for Ordinary Differential Equations
